			<h1>Raw file vs JPEG file</h1>
				<h2>Raw File Overview</h2>
					<p>Raw files are image files. Raw files are used for images. A typical file in this format contains a short file header, camerea sensor metadata, image thumbnail, and sensor image data. Common places a Raw file is used are in uncompressed camerea pictures. When a photo is taken, it is stored as a Raw file. </p>
				<h2>History of Format</h2>
					<p>Raw file format was created by Adobe. TIFF file format was around at the time of RAW file format. RAW file format is still in use. Raw file format is open source.</p>
				<h2>Compression</h2>
					<p> Raw file format doesn't use compression, so it is lossless. A typical file size for a RAW file is around 26MB uncompressed. It is around 10 MB compressed. One average it compresses a file 60.9%.</p>
				<h2> Similar Formats and Advangates/Disadvantages </h2>
					<p> A format similar to RAW is a TIFF. RAW is good for preserving the quality in a photo. The advantages are that it has amazing quality, but the disadvantages are that it uses a lot more space than a regular JPEG. TIFF provides a higher quality but it has an even larger file than a RAW image(uncompressed).  </p>

				<h2> Compression </h2>
					<p> JPEG does use compression.It uses lossy file compression. A typical file size is around 3 MB after compression (pjpinella). On average it compresses from 51.59% to 6.05%. (Graphic Mill)
				<h2> JPEG File Overview </h2>
					<p> JPEG or Joint Photohrapgic Experts Group.(JPEG.org) It is used for images. A typical file contains color space definition, Component sub-sampling registration, and Pixel aspect ratio definition. This format is commonly used to compress images. JPEGs turn uncompressed images into comrpessed images. </p>
				<h2> Format History </h2>
					<p> JPEG was createdted by Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1992 (JPEG.org). EXIF file format was around at the same time. JPEG is still in use and is one of the most used file formats in today's world. It is an open source file format.

				<h2>Similar Formats and Advantages/Disadvantages
					<p> GIF file format is similar becuase they are both lossy commpression file types. JPEG is good for have good quality images, while having low memory use at the same time. JPEG advantages over similar formats is that it provides better quality than a gif or any silialr file format types. JPEG, compared to uncompressed file formats, is inferioir in image quality. There is no other formats Better than JPEG in having lossy compression while also have great quality.
